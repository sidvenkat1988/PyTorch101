# PyTorch101

This repository is created is order to get hands-on with PyTorch to build Deep Learning models. This is made purely based on Daniel Voigt Godoy's teachings in the GitHub link below:

https://github.com/dvgodoy/PyTorch101_ODSC_London2019

The following steps were followed in order to create an environment for this practice:

1) A new environment called "pytorch101" was created using the following command: conda create -n pytorch101 pip condo python==3.6.8

2) The above environment was activated using: conda activate pytorch101

3) GraphViz was installed using: pip install graphviz

4) PyTorch was installed using: conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch

5) Packages like scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Jupyter, ipywidgets and plotly were installed using: conda install scikit-learn==0.21.3 matplotlib==3.1.1 jupyter==1.0.0 ipywidgets==7.5.1 plotly==4.1.1 -c anaconda

6) Torchviz was installed using: pip install torchviz
